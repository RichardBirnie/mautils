#' situations where analyses are required for many different treatment
#' comparisons in a single project or multiple different meta-analysis models
#' need to be fitted for the same data set. The functions provided are mainly
#' simple wrappers around functions from the meta package for direct
#' meta-analysis or the gemtc package for network meta-analysis.
