Description: This package provides a collection of helper functions to support an automated workflow
  for meta-analysis. This is mainly intended to be used in situations where analyses are required for
  many different treatment comparisons in a single project or multiple different meta-analysis models
  need to be fitted for the same data set. The functions provided are mainly simple wrappers around
  functions from the meta package for direct meta-analysis or the gemtc package for network meta-analysis.
