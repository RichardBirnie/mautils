Description: This package provides a collection of helper functions to support
    an automated workflow for meta-analysis. This is mainly intended to be used in
    situations where analyses are required for many different treatment comparisons
    in a single project or multiple different meta-analysis models need to be fitted
    for the same data set. The functions provided are mainly simple wrappers around
    functions from the meta package for direct meta-analysis or the gemtc package
    for network meta-analysis.
